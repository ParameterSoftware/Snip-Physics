##Situation
This section is currently made of old obsolete code that I do not plan on using or fixing up. Instead I plan to recreate it in the [Spartan Engine] [1] and then place the new code here. After I start the new code here, it will be devoted to any kind of physics you feel you can implement but for now it is pointless until the Spartan Engine physics are in.
