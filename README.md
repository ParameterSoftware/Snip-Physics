##About

This is a little out of date. I will give a full and proper update to this when I start advancing physics in the [Spartan Engine][1] and will work on this for physics. This will be more then just gaming physics when it is complete. It will be a free, open source physics engine

##End Objective
- Gravity and 3D Gravitational Forces
- Collision through Collision Models (or if missing, use the original graphic model file to generate a basic rectangular prism surrounding the object)
- Realistic Air Resistance and Friction (calculated through Gravity or/and other physics properties)
- Skeletal Body System with limits. Planned to allow bone breaking and joint busting. 
- Projectiles will be real objects with a large velocity
- More Objectives (will be expanded upon soon)
